## Dialing In

More dose doesn't necessarily reduce bitterness.
Bitterness could also come from more material get extracted.
The real over-extraction signal is bitter in long lasting aftertaste.
If reducing dose leads to balance then this is the case.

If ground suddenly lose pressure for no reason,
it is probably because CO2 is leaking too much since beans are not consumed in time,
just grind half level finer (Niche Duo) and it should be fine again.

It is important to discard some ground right after changing the grind settings,
otherwise different sizes of ground will mix together and make channeling happen more easily.

Over-weighted dose could also lead to uneven extraction
because the puck expands all the way to the group head,
leaving no room for spreading water evenly.

Sweetness is an attribute of a certain bean.
But it may need higher temperature.

To having more acidity:
- Increasing pressure could prevent from having risk of weaker flavor.
- Increasing dose could decrease flow rate, having a risk of over extraction.
- Coarser grinding could lead to risk of weaker flavor.

When doing espresso with ice and fresh milk without frothing,
bitter will become obvious,
extraction needs to be lower while keeping high concentration.

## To Try

- Changing pressure during extraction, 9\~6 or 9\~0.
- Changing temperature during extraction (tap the thermometer to set declining temperature).

- Denser puck (or slower flow) increases body, decreases the risk of channeling.
  - Increase the flow rate of pre-infusion.
  - Increase puck weight
  - Decrease the space between the puck and the shower screen (by using smaller basket).
- Looser puck increases characteristic.
- Thicker puck increases body (by using taper basket).
