## Decent Pro / Niche Duo

### 9-6bar, 92C
- 11.5/20.5 -> 9/15s 32.0g
- 9/20.0g -> 9/20s 33.0g, fine
- 8/20.0g -> 8/24s 30.9g, slightly bitter
- 8.5/20.0g -> 8/23s 30.8g, weaker flavor
- 8.0/21.0g -> 8/29s 28.3g, sweet, weaker flavor at the beginning but turns good later
  - try 20.5g ground

## 9bar, 94C
- 8.0/20.0g -> 8/24s 29.4g, sweet but slightly bitter

## 9/20.0g
- 9bar/94C -> 7s/16s 28.7g, obvious acidity, a little sweet
- 9bar/94C -> 8/20s 34.5g
- 9bar/88C -> 8/18 31.5g, less obvious acidity, no sweetness
- 6bar/88C -> 8/19s 30.9g, less obvious acidity, a little sweet
- 6bar/94C -> 8/18s 30.0g, more acidity, a little sweet
- 9bar/94C -> 8/19s 30.4g, a little sweet

acidity and flow rate is not significantly changed,
it could because the ground is too coarse,
try 8 grind and run through the experiment again.

## 8/20.0g on 18g basket
- 9bar/94C -> 6/21s 31.1g, obvious flavor, little bitter, little sweet aftertaste
- 9bar/88C -> 6/22s 30.5g, more acidity
- 6bar/88C -> 7/23s 30.1g, bitter, no sweet at all
- 6bar/94C -> 7/22s 29.5g, bitter, weaker flavor, sweet aftertaste
  - on 20g basket -> 8/23s 30.2g, nothing changed

## 6/20.0g
