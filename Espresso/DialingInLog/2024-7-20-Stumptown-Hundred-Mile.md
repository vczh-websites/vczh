**sweet aftertaste**

- 13/20.0g -> 8/21s 40.6g, under extraction
- 12/20.0g -> 8/23s 41.0g, under extraction, very weak sweet aftertaste
- 10.5/20.0g -> 8/27s 40.5g, aromatic, good creama, puck a little watery, good flavor, disappearing in a few seconds, noticible but weak sweet aftertaste stays long
- 10/20.0g -> 8/34s 40.4g, stronger flavors, sweet aftertaste grows fast
  - yes!
  - use lucerne instead of organic valley
    - 8/32s -> 41.5g
    - could be channeling at the very end but doesn't matter
    - repros, milk also doesn't matter
- 10/20.0g -> 8/27s 41.6g, pressure stable, slightly weaker flavor, slightly bitter, obvious sweet aftertaste
- 10/21.0g -> 8/34s 41.3g, aromatic, perfect creama, stronger flavor but fading fast, no bitter, less but long lasting sweet aftertaste
  - need deeper extraction
- 9.5/20.5g -> 8/34s 41.2g
  - yes!
  - -> 8/35s 41.2g
  - 20.7g -> 8/37s 43.5g
  - 8/36s 42.4g, repros, may need to extract deeper the next time as the bean seems losing pressure very slowly
  - 8/34s 42.3g
- 9/20.5g -> 8/37s 41.6g, aromatic, perfect creama, strong flavor, just a little bit bitter, significantly more sweet aftertaste
