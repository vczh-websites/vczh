### 8bar/92C

- 5/20.0 -> 8/15s 39.8g 5.3ml/s, sour but unexpectly also rich flavor, low thickness
  - too fast
- 2.5/20.0g -> 7/22s 40.0g 1.7\~2.4ml/s, spice, burnt, good thickness, not sweet at all

### 6bar/92C

- 3/20.0g -> 8/21s 29.8g 1.7\~2.3ml/s, still spice and burnt
- 4/20.0g -> 8/17s 29.9g 2.7\~3.1ml/s, feel like cran berry, unnoticeable sweet in aftertaste
  - try 3.5 grind

### 9bar/94C

- 4/20.0g -> 8/14s 30.1g 4ml/s, a little bit sweet, flavor emphasized
- 3.5/20.0g -> 8/17s 39.2g 3.2\~3.8ml/s, there is sweetness but bitterness is so obvious
  - channeling? wrong recording?
- 3.5/20.0g -> 9/18s 30.0g 2.3\~2.7ml/s, less cran berry, more almond, some sweet
  - no taste of burnt, tolerable bitterness in aftertaste
  - try again and see the flow rate
    - with more milk, like 7oz
    - if still a little bit bitter, try 3.75 grind

### 7oz frothed milk

- 3.5/20.0g -> 8/16s 30.1g 3.5\~3.8ml/s, very balanced and some sweet
  - fast flow rate back again
- 3.5/20.0g -> 8/19s 40.1g 2.5\~3.4ml/s, much more thickness, but a little unbalanced
  - flow rate seems not stable for this bean
