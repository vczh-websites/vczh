### 9bar/93C

- 4/20.0g -> 7/42s 39.9g 0.4\~1.4ml/s, bitter and sweet
- 5.5/20.0g -> 7/24s 39.8g 1.5\~2.2ml/s, flavor emphasized but also bitter (why?), still sweet
- 6.5/20.0g -> 8/21s 40.3g 1.9\~2.7ml/s, balanced

### 6bar/95C

- 7/20.0g -> 8/21s 40.0g 2.1\~3.1ml/s, thickness is fine, sweet
  - Didn't get the cherry taste from note

### 9\~1bar/94C

- 7/20.0g -> 8/19s 40.6g 2.5\~2.9ml/s, not much changed
- 7.5/20.0g -> 8/17s 39.5g 3.8\~4.1ml/s, not much changed
  - why so fast? 6\~1 barbresults in a slightly lower flow rate, which mean this one may be right, not because of channeling
  - why no change?

### 6~1bar/92C

- 7.5/20.0g -> 9/18s 39.1g 3.1\~3.4ml/s, rich flavor, balanced, sweet, cherry but not obvious
  - yes!
  - try 6 bar flat, aftertaste is kind of too strong

### 6bar/92C

- 7.5/20.0g -> 8/20s 38.9g 3.6ml/s, bitter
  - suddenly lose pressure and flow rate jumps to 4.5ml/s, is it channeling?
- 7.5/20.0g -> 8/17s 40.2g 3.5\~3.7ml/s, pulling 1.5oz less frothed milk, sweet but a little bit bitter

### 6bar/92C on 18g basket

- 7.5/20.0g -> 7/17s 40.1g 3.2\~3.3ml/s, bitterness emphasized while flavor unchanged, expected
- 7.5/20.0g -> 8/13s 30.6g 4ml/s, obvious sweet in actertaste but comes later, flavor emphasized but a little bit bitter, is it channeling?
  - why 4ml/s? repeat it tomorrow
  - repeat also with 20oz basket, 18oz might make channeling easier
  - repeat canceled, degas proven

### 9bar/92C on 15g basket

- 6/15.0g -> 7/12s 30.2g 5ml/s, smooth, sweet, flavor no clarity
- 4.5/15.0g -> 6/15s 30.1g 2.5\~2.8ml/s, thickness increased a lot, flavor also emphasized, no bitterness

### 6bar/92C

- 4.5/15.5g -> 6/17s 30.1g 2.1\~2.8ml/s, balanced, tea like, bitterness completedly removed while thicknrss kept
  - yes!
