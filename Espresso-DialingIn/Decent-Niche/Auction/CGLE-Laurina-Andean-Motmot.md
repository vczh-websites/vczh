### 8bar/94C

- 6/20.0g -> 8/28s 40.8g 1.0\~2.1ml/s, raisin emphasized, a little sour in aftertaste

  - -> 8/27s 40.4g 1.2\~2.2ml/s
    - Bean is releasing CO2 but today's flow rate comoletedly eliminated bitterness, which is good!

### Scale calibrated (2024-10-5)

- 4.5/20.0g -> 8/24s 40.7g 1.6\~2.2ml/s, body over emphasized, a little bit bitter in aftertaste
  - could be channeling, give another try
- 4.75/20.0g -> 9/20s 40.3g 2.5\~2.9ml/s, under extraction
- 4.0/20.0g -> 7/26s 40.3g 1.2\~2.1ml/s, sweet, balanced, but a little bit bitter in aftertaste

- 4.5/20.0g -> 8/24s 40.1g 1.5\~2.4ml/s, much more sweet, floral
  - yes! recipe for 1 week after roasted
  - using a flat pressure for a consistant raising flow rate, it could extract less in the finishing and maximize the flavor

- 4.25/20.0g -> 8/25s 38.0g 1.2\~2.1ml/s
