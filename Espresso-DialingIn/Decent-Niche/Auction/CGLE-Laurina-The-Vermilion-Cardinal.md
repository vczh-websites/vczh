### 9bar/94C

- 6/20.0g -> 8/21s 41.5g 2.1\~2.8ml/s, strong grape juicy taste, wine, too sour, some sweet
- 5/20g -> 8/26s 41.3g 1.2\~2.2ml/s, better balanced but flavor a little bit over emphasized
- 4.5/20.0g -> 7/33s 40.7g 0.7\~1.9ml/s, flavor a little bit less emphasized, but body is good
  - try variety pressure
  - try 4.75 grind
- 4.75/20.0g -> 8/38s 40.6g 0.8\~2.7ml/s, flavor a little bit better emphasized, sweet comes later
  - flow rate doesn't look right and increases very fast in the last 2 seconds, very likely channeling
- 4.75/20.0g -> 8/32s 40.3g 0.8\~2.0ml/s, sweet, grape fruit and wine comes back
  - yes!
  - compare 4.75 and 5 grind next time
- 4.75/20.0g ->
- 4.75/20.0g ->
  - skip this cup if the previous one looks/taste right
- 5/20.0g ->
