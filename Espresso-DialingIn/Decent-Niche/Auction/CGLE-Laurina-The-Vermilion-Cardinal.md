### 9bar/94C

- 6/20.0g -> 8/21s 41.5g 2.1\~2.8ml/s, strong grape juicy taste, wine, too sour, some sweet
- 5/20g -> 8/26s 41.3g 1.2\~2.2ml/s, better balanced but flavor a little bit over emphasized
- 4.5/20.0g -> 7/33s 40.7g 0.7\~1.9ml/s, flavor a little bit less emphasized, but body is good
  - try variety pressure
  - try 4.75 grind
- 4.75/20.0g -> 8/38s 40.6g 0.8\~2.7ml/s, flavor a little bit better emphasized, sweet comes later
  - flow rate doesn't look right and increases very fast in the last 2 seconds, very likely channeling
- 4.75/20.0g -> 8/32s 40.3g 0.8\~2.0ml/s, sweet, grape fruit and wine comes back
  - yes!
  - compare 4.75 and 5 grind next time

### Scale calibrated (2024-10-5)

- 4/20.0g -> 8/22s 40.5ml/s 1.8\~2.7ml/s
- 3.5/20.0g -> 8/26s 40.3g 1.1\~2.2ml/s
  - flow rate looks like 5/20.0g
  - but Niche Duo only adjusts by 1 unit, could due to CO2 releasing
- 3/20.0g -> 7/24s 40.3g 1.3\~2.2ml/s
- 3.25/20.0g -> 8/24s 40.6g 2.5\~3.4ml/s, balanced, some sweet
  - wine tasting comes back at this very narrow grind setting
- 3.25/20.0g -> 8/24s 40.4g 1.3\~2.2ml/s, very little bitter in aftertaste
- 3.5/20.0g -> 9/22s 40.0g 1.9\~2.4ml/s

### 9~3bar/94C

- 3.25/20.0g -> 8/21s 36.7g 1.7\~2.3ml/s, acidity a little but over emphasized
  - yield 36g and 40g next time

### 9~3bar/94C

- 3.5/20.0g -> 7/28s 40.4g 1.1\~2.1ml/s, bitter

### 9bar/94C

- 4.0/20.0g -> 7/22s 39.9g 1.6\~2.4ml/s, good thickness, needs more emphasizing flavor

### 9~4bar/94C

- 4.0/20.0g -> 7/24s 40.0g 1.4\~2.4ml/s, still need more emohasizing flavor
  - try 91C
