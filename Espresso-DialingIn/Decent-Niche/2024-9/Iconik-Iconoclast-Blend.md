### 9bar/92C

- 6/20.0g -> 7/26s 40.9g 1.2~1.9ml/s, sweet comes later, acidity too much
- 5/20.0g -> 7/40s 40.9g 0.5~1.6ml/s, weaker flavor, obvious bitter aftertaste
- 5.5/20.0g -> 7/32s 30.3g 0.7~1.4ml/s, accidentally 1:1.5, slightly weaker acidity, sweet, weak aftertaste
- 5.5/20.0g -> 7/32s 40.3g 0.8~1.8ml/s, weaker flavor at first sip but turns better later, body enough, obvious acidity, weak sweet aftertaste
  - time looks wrong comparing to others

### 9bar/94C

- 5.5/20.0g -> 7/36s 40.1g 0.7~1.7ml/s, balanced, sweet aftertaste
  - try 7/9~6 bar
- 6/20.0g -> 7/27s 40.8g 1.1~1.9ml/s, sweet and balanced
  - need to test temperature effect once more

### 9bar/92C

- 6/20.0g -> 7/31s 40.1g 0.9~1.7ml/s, a little bit more acidity, leaving some in aftertaste
  - the first cup in this sheet doesn't seem right
  - after starting Decent it should wait about 5 minutes and flush the basket to ensure first cup consistency
  - lower temperature makes more acidity and slower flow rat

### 9bar/94C

- 6/20.0g -> 7/28s 41.0g 1.0~1.9ml/s, repros

### 6bar/94C
