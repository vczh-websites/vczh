### 9bar/92C

- 6/20.0g -> 7/26s 40.9g 1.2~1.9ml/s, sweet comes later, acidity too much
- 5/20.0g -> 7/40s 40.9g 0.5~1.6ml/s, weaker flavor, obvious bitter aftertaste
- 5.5/20.0g -> 7/32s 30.3g 0.7~1.4ml/s, accidentally 1:1.5, slightly weaker acidity, sweet, weak aftertaste
- 5.5/20.0g -> 7/32s 40.3g 0.8~1.8ml/s, weaker flavor at first sip but turns better later, body enough, obvious acidity, weak sweet aftertaste
  - time looks wrong comparing to others

### 9bar/94C

- 5.5/20.0g -> 7/36s 40.1g 0.7~1.7ml/s, balanced, sweet aftertaste
- 6/20.0g -> 7/27s 40.8g 1.1~1.9ml/s, sweet and balanced
  - need to test temperature effect once more

### 9bar/92C

- 6/20.0g -> 7/31s 40.1g 0.9~1.7ml/s, a little bit more acidity, leaving some in aftertaste
  - the first cup in this sheet doesn't seem right
  - after starting Decent it should wait about 5 minutes and flush the basket to ensure first cup consistency
  - lower temperature makes more acidity and slower flow rat

### 9bar/94C

- 6/20.0g -> 7/28s 41.0g 1.0~1.9ml/s, repros

### 6bar/94C

- 6/20.0g -> 7/27s 41.0g 1.1~2.2ml/s, still sweet, flavor emphasized but wired, acidity in aftertaste

### 8bar/94C

- 6/20.0g -> 7/30s 40.6g 0.9~1.9ml/s, flavor emphasized but no acidity in aftertaste
  - repeat this next time
  - -> 7/26s 40.2g 1.2~2.1ml/s, less sweetness, slightly bitter
    - first cup of the day, flow rate ia too fast
  - -> 7/28s 40.3g 1.0~1.9ml/s, no bitter, pretty repros
- 6/17.5g -> 7/22s 36.4g 1.5~2.2ml/s, less flavor, less sweetness, no bitter, stronger sweet aftertaste
  - bean not enough, 17.5 ground put in 18g basket, turns out less dose requires finer ground
