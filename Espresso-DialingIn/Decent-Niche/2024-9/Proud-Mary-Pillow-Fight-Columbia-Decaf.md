## Decent Pro / Niche Duo

### 9bar/94C

- 8/20.0g -> 9/19s 40.5g 4ml/s, too much acidity
- 6/20.0g -> 7/24s 40.3g 2~1.8ml/s, very fruity, acidity with clarity
- 5.5/20.0g -> 7/27s 41.4g 1.6ml/s, thicker body, balanced

### 9~6bar/94C

- 5.5/20.0g -> 9/27s 40.4g 9\~8bar 1.5\~2ml/s, body slightly too strong
  - I don't know if changing to a glass cup will affect the taste since it keeps latte warmer

### 9bar/94C

- 5.5/20.0g -> 8/27s 40.8g 1.6ml/s, repros
  - glass cup doesn't affect the taste
  - yes!
  - try different temperature
