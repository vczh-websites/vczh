### 9~9bar/92C

- 10/20.0g -> 8/23s 30.8g, bitter
- 10/21.0g -> 7/21s 30.5g, less bitter, more sweet

### 9~7bar/94C

- 10/21.0g -> 8/20s 30.6g, strong and clear flavor, sweet
  - yes!
  - try 9 grind next time

### 9~9bar/94C

- 10/21.0g -> 8/24s 40.0g, much more body
  - still prefer 1:1.5 yield

### 9~7bar/94C

- 10/20.0g -> 10/20s 31.7g, bitter and slightly sweet aftertaste
- 10/22.0g -> 7/22s 31.2g, dose too big
  - 22g does not fit in 20g basket

### 9~9bar/94C

- 10/21.0g -> 7/19s 30.2g, balanced, sweet
  - yes!
  - grind >> pressure = temperature
- 9/20.0g -> 7/21s 29.9g, bitter
- 10/20.0g -> 7/17s 32.5g, milk tea, flavor enough, not clarity enough, not bitter at all, somewhat sweet aftertaste, sweetness comes later
  - better, need to improve characteristic without brining more body
  - 1g less dose decreases body a lot, it might because of the higher flow rate, jumps from 2.5 to 3.5

**FRESH**

### 9bar/94C

- 10/20.0g -> 7/19s 41.4g 2.5\~3.5ml/s, obvious taste of fementation, clarity, milk tea, sweet in aftertaste, a little bit bitter long lasting
  - first cup of the day, data doesn't match record, try again
- 10/20.0g -> 7/19s 40.7g 2.5\~2.8ml/s, sour, not bitterness, less sweet, less milk tea
  - machine stable, previous cup proven channeling
- 8/20.0g -> 6/42s 40.4g 0.4\~1.5ml/s, over extraction
- 9/20.0g -> 7/29s 39.8g 1.0\~2.0ml/s, much less but still bitter
  - try 9.5 grind
  - try 10 grind with 7/9\~4bar
- 9.5/20.0g -> 6/22s 40.5g 1.8\~2.2ml/s, flavor over emphasized, obvious sweet aftertaste
  - first cup of the day

### 9~4bar/94C

- 9.5/20.0g -> 7/24s 40.3g 1.6\~2.2ml/s 9\~7.8bar, less emphasized citrus flavor, milk tea, less sweet in aftertaste
  - a little bit taste of glass when getting cold
  - flavor should have been emphasized by dropping the pressure, but here it may because of the dropping of density
  - sometimes dropping pressure doesn't dramatically affect flownrate this much, this could also be the reason

### 9~4bar/92C

- 9.5/20.0g -> 7/26s 40.5g 1.5\~2.1ml/s 9\~7.3bar, increased body (why?) and milk tea feeling, sweet aftertaste comes later but long lasting
  - decreasing temperature seems to affect to pressure as well
  - the best temperature on sweet aftertaste seems to drop when pressure drops
  - flavor emphasized when getting cold
- 9.5/20.0g -> 8/25s 40.2g 1.6\~2.1ml/s, much more sour
  - first cup of the day
  - use a wide cup, it seems to lower the temperature od the espresso too fast
  - flow rate and time looks right, changing of the taste could due to the temperature drop
- 9.5/20.0g -> 7/23s 40.8g 1.7\~2.2ml/s, sweet, good thickness, obvious critus flavor than yesterday and lasts in aftertaste
  - back to the deep cup for consistency
  - flow rate increases a little bit
- 9/20.0g -> 8/31s 39.9g 0.9\~1.9ml/s, more sweet, significantly less flavor
  - will increasing density bring the emphasized flavor (no) or sweetness back (yes)? 
- 10/20.0g -> 8/21s 40.2g 2.2\~2.7ml/s, less sweet, significantly more flavor and even too much
  - will increasing flow rate bring the emphasized flavor (yes) or sweetness back (no)?
  - looks like 9.5 in 9~4bar/92C is still too sour but also the most appropriate grind setting
- 9.5/20.0g ->
  - first cup of the day, as a baseline, and bring pressure and temperature back

### 9bar/92C

- 9.5/20.0g ->

### 9bar/94C

- 9.5/20.0g ->
