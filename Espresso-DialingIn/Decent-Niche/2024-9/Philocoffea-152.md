### 9~9bar/92C

- 10/20.0g -> 8/23s 30.8g, bitter
- 10/21.0g -> 7/21s 30.5g, less bitter, more sweet

### 9~7bar/94C

- 10/21.0g -> 8/20s 30.6g, strong and clear flavor, sweet
  - yes!
  - try 9 grind next time

### 9~9bar/94C

- 10/21.0g -> 8/24s 40.0g, much more body
  - still prefer 1:1.5 yield

### 9~7bar/94C

- 10/20.0g -> 10/20s 31.7g, bitter and slightly sweet aftertaste
- 10/22.0g -> 7/22s 31.2g, dose too big
  - 22g does not fit in 20g basket

### 9~9bar/94C

- 10/21.0g -> 7/19s 30.2g, balanced, sweet
  - yes!
  - grind >> pressure = temperature
- 9/20.0g -> 7/21s 29.9g, bitter
- 10/20.0g -> 7/17s 32.5g, milk tea, flavor enough, not clarity enough, not bitter at all, somewhat sweet aftertaste, sweetness comes later
  - better, need to improve characteristic without brining more body
  - 1g less dose decreases body a lot, it might because of the higher flow rate, jumps from 2.5 to 3.5
