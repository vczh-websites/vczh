**NOT FRESH**

### 8bar/92C

- 6/20.0g -> 7/36s 40.1g 0.6~1.5ml/s, sweet, a little bitter in aftertaste
  - first cup of the day, try again
  - too fast, next day try waiting for 10 minutes before first cup
- 6/20.0g -> 37.4g 7/42s, obvious bitter
  - "rinse and hold" state reaches maximum
- 8/20.0g -> 7/24s 42.2g 1.7~2.1ml/s, less sweetness, flavor fine but could be more emphasized

### 6bar/92C

- 8/20.0g -> 7/25s 39.4g 1.5~2.2ml/s, flavor enough

### 6bar/94C

- 8/20.0g -> 7/28s 40.3g 1.2~2.1ml/s, more sweetness, less flavor, thickness might be not enough, a little bitter in aftertaste
  - try 8.5/9 grind, and raise pressure
- 8.5/20.0g -> 7/22s 40.9g 2.0\~2.3ml/s 94\~93\~94C, bitter, ~taste like channeling~
  - frist cup of the day
  - difference of the taste could due to food prior latte
- 8.5/20.0g -> 7/21s 40.6g 2.2\~2.5ml/s 93.7\~93\~93.5C, more balanced, sweet
  - waiting for 12 minutes before the first cup looks pretty stable in extraction

### 9bar/94C

- 8.5/20.0g -> 7/20s 40.7g 2.2\~2.4ml/s 93.7\~93\~93.5C, thicker body, just a little bit less emphasized flavor in the beginning but increased later, not bitterness at all
- 8/20.0g -> 7/26s 40.4g 1.3\~1.9ml/s 93.5\~93\~93.7C, a little bit more sweet, thicker body, a little bit but comfortable bitterness in aftertaste, turning weak sweet later
