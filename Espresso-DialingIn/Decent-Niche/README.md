# Dialing Log

using

- Decent Pro 1.45
- Niche Duo

Decent needs to rest for 10 minutes after wakes up.

If the bean is sensitive to extraction settings,
it is recommended to flush the basket with bot water and then keep the portafilter in the machine for a while,
to ensure the basket for the first shot is as hot as the second shot.
The temperature of the basket does affect extraction for some beans.

Sometimes the tablet double clicks, don't press the left side of the OK button after changing brewing parameters, it overlaps with the power button, there is a low possibility that the machine will be turned off. 

## Niche Duo Calibration

- 2024-10-5, 6<-7 (Philocoffea 152)
  - I don't think Niche Duo'ring was loosen, it could due to bean residual affecting the sound.
  - But I adjusted it to be 1 smaller anyway.
  - Take this log so that if I get any chance to install a new burr I should zeroing it again and see if I need to adjust it 1 larger back.
  - Tasted Philocoffea 152 and CGLE vermilion cardinal, all needs to grind 1.5 unit finer, but Niche Duo only adjusts by 1 unit, could because bean is releasing CO2.

### No!

## TODO:

- How to extract much more at the first part to make a thick 1:1.5 extraction while maximized flavor and sweetness?

## Keep extraction stable

- Wait 7 minites before grinding after turning on the machine.
- Flush the basket after every extraction.

## Dialing In (flow profile)

- Starts from pressure profile and get a proper grind size to keep flow around 2.0ml/s.
- Starts from flow profile`4.0ml/s -> 2.0ml/s on 9bar/94C`.
- Slightly increase the target flow rate cause the pressure to increase significantly, which extracts more.
- Decrease the target flow rate cause the pressure to decrease significantly, which extracts less.

### Hypothesis

- Flow cannot increase as high as you want, decent believes higher flow requires higher pressure, but there is a pressure limit.
- Decreasing flow lower the extraction.

### Test

- Increasing flow rate during extraction.
- Decreasing flow rate during extraction

## Dialing In (pressure profile)

- Decide a proper dose, usually 18g ground in 18g basket, so that after brewing the group head doesn't leave a imprint on the paper screen. Having a little gap between the group head and the swelling puck will increase the evenness of extraction.
- Start from `Default` with 9bar/92C.
- Adjust to the best grind setting.
- Adjust temperature and pressure to make the espresso better.
- Use `Default` (temperature/pressure variety) profile even when you don't need variation of pressure or temperature.
  - `Classic Italian Espresso` has an extra stop condition of maximum brew time after pre-infusion, this is useless in most of the cases.
  - Only do variation pressure or temperature when fixed profile is not good enough.
  - If flow rate raises too fast, consider brewing with a higher temperature and a decreasing pressure profile.
- If the finest ground still under extraction, try 20g.
- If the good extraction looks too coarse, or flavor too dense (happened to Bach) try 15g.

## Milk Frothing

Tilt jar,
ensure steam hole close to side,
ensure milk just cover the hole,
start and adjust the distance quickly.
At \~12s, raise the jar, stop at \~22s.

Swirl the milk somewhat but not too gentally.

Don't froth too thick,
pull foam from 12oz to 20oz jar before latte art.

When doing 7oz in deeper cup,
stop at \~25s,
integrate less and pour nearer.
