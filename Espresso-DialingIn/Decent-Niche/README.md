## No!

## Keep extraction stable

- Wait longer than 5 minites after turning on the machine for the first cup.
- Flush the basket before every extraction.

## Dialing In

- Decide a proper dose, usually 20g ground in 20g basket, so that after brewing the group head doesn't leave a imprint on the paper screen.
- Start from `Classic Italian Espresso` with 8bar/90-92C.
- Adjust to the best grind setting.
- Adjust temperature and then pressure to make the espresso better.
- Only doing temperature/pressure variety profile when fixed profile is not good enough.

## Milk Frothing

Tilt jar,
ensure steam hole close to side,
ensure milk just cover the hole,
start and adjust the distance quickly.
At \~12s, raise the jar, stop at \~22s.

Swirl the milk somewhat but not too gentally.

Don't froth too thick,
pull foam from 12oz to 20oz jar before latte art.
