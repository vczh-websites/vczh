## No!

## Keep extraction stable

- Wait longer than 10 minites after turning on the machine for the first cup.
- Flush the basket before every extraction (not important but better to do it).

## Dialing In

- Decide a proper dose, usually 20g ground in 20g basket, so that after brewing the group head doesn't leave a imprint on the paper screen.
- Start from `Classic Italian Espresso` with 8bar/90-92C.
  - There is a time limit in the `Hold` state, since `Decline` is disabled, that is the maximum brewing time after pre-infusion.
  - If the maximum of 1 minute is not enough, consider using the `Default` profile.
- Adjust to the best grind setting.
- Adjust temperature and then pressure to make the espresso better.
- Only doing `Default` (temperature/pressure variety) profile when fixed profile is not good enough.

## Milk Frothing

Tilt jar,
ensure steam hole close to side,
ensure milk just cover the hole,
start and adjust the distance quickly.
At \~12s, raise the jar, stop at \~22s.

Swirl the milk somewhat but not too gentally.

Don't froth too thick,
pull foam from 12oz to 20oz jar before latte art.

When doing 7oz in deeper cup,
stop at \~25s,
integrate less and pour nearer.
