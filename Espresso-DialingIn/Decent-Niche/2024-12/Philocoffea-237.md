2024-12-11 (roasted on 2024-12-1)

### 6bar/94C

- 2/15.0g -> 7/15s 30.1g 2.7\~3.1ml/s, clarity not enough, very sweet, no obvious aftertaste
- 1/15.0g -> 6/20s 30.3g 1.4\~2.2ml/s, less sweetness, is it a little over extraction?

### 2.0ml/s -> 2.0ml/s on 8bar/94C

- 1.5/15.0g -> 15/26s 29.9g 5.8\~3.1bar, balanced
  - yes!
- 1/15.0g -> 16/28s 30.0g 5.7\~3.1bar, a little less sweet and more bitter
  - 1.5 grind still better
- 1.5/15.0g -> 14/26s 30.0g 5.4\~3.6bar, a little bit bitter
  - used organic valley instead of maple hill
- 1.5/15.0g -> 13/25s 30.1g 5.0\~3.1bar
  - used maple hill again, taste of fat in milk is obvious
