### 9~1bar/92C

- 2/18.0g -> 8/23s 36.0g 1.3\~2.1ml/s, flavor so strong, could feel some bitterness
- 3/18.0g -> 7/19s 35.9g 2.1\~2.7ml/s
  - yes!

### 6~1bar/94C

- 3/18.0g -> 8/17s 36.0g 2.9\~3.2ml/s, good clarity
  - try 2.5 grind, hope density to be just below 9\~1/92C/3
- (2024-12-31)
- 2.5/18.0g -> 9/24s 36.5g 1.8\~2.7ml/s, a little bit bitter
- 2.75/18.0g -> 5.5ml/s, unexpectedly good clarity
  - why?
- 2.75/18.0g -> 3bar 4ml/s
  - 2.75 too coarse but 2.5 is good, doesn't make sense
- 2.5/18.0g ->
