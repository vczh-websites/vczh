### 9bar/94C

- 3/15.0g -> no pressure
- 0.5/15.0g -> 7/13s 31.3g \~4.7ml/s
- -0.5/20.0g -> 8/28s 41.4g 0.8\~2.3ml/s, flavor low

### on 18g basket

- -1/20.0g -> 7/30s 40.8g 0.6\~2.4ml/s, taste of milk obvious
  - try 6bar or 4bar 96C 1:2 or 1:4

### 4bar/96C -> 60g

- 0.5/20.0g -> 7/28s 60.0g 1.0\~4.2ml/s, flavor emphasized, but I can't tell it is sour or bitter

### 4\~1bar/93C

- 0/20.0g -> 7/30s 50.7g 0.7\~3.0ml/s, a little bit balanced, fruity, unnoticeable sweetness, no bitterness
  - still too hot but fine
  - roaster suggests it is still under extraction
