### 9~1bar/92C 35.5g (6oz milk)

- 5/18.0g -> 7/26s 36.2g 1.1\~1.9ml/s
  - without milk: some bitterness, stone fruit
  - with mlik: a few herbal, sweet, fruity no clarity, a little sweetness in aftertaste
- 6.5/18.0g -> 8/17s 36.5g 2.6\~2.9ml/s
  - without milk: strong acidity, sweetness, apple juice
  - with mlik: very sweet, milk tea, herbal
- 6/18.0g -> 8/20s 36.5g 2.0\~2.5ml/s
  - without milk: just begin to introduce a little bitterness, strong sweetness
  - with milk: even more sweet

> Acidity almost not tastable with milk,
next day try to do espresso only,
try 7 grind, and coarser with 1:2.5 ~ 1:3 yield.
Also explore 1:1.5 yield with finer grind with and without milk.

### 9~1bar/92C 35.5g without milk

- 7/18.0g -> 8/15s 36.2g \~4ml/s
  - could be degased, 6 grind could be better now
- 6/18.0g -> 7/18s 35.8g 2.2\~2.7ml/s, sweet, but strong bitterness in aftertaste

### 6~1bar/92C without milk

- 8/18.0g 44g -> 9/16s 44.3g 5.8\~5.6bar \~5.2ml/s, strong acidity, obvious honey, some sweetness and less bitterness in aftertaste than last cup

> When >= 7 grind espresso ejects all over the machine,
this could indicate a sign of channeling,
considering the strong acidity with bitterness in aftertaste,
might need to try <6 grind 1:1.5 yield, or lower temperature e.g. 85C

  - doesn't taste like channeling
- 2/16.0g 29g -> 30.0g 7/35s 0.4\~1.3ml/s, balance, sweetness with a little bitterness, much less bitterness in aftertaste with aroma from throat
