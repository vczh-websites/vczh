### 9~1bar/92C, 7.5 glass cup with 6oz milk

- 5/15.0g -> 6/27s 30.1g 0.9\~1.4ml/s, bitter, adding more milk lost flavor
  - brown spot on espresso, could be too fine
- 6/15.0g -> 6/20s 30.0g 1.4\~2.0ml/s, still bitter, milk could be not enough, adding more milk still preserve flavor
  - brown spot still exist

### 9oz glass cup with 6oz milk

- 6/15.0g -> 6/18s 30.0g 1.8\~2.2ml/s, milk tea, flavor emphasized, start to taste sweetness, still a little bitter in aftertaste
  - why faster?
