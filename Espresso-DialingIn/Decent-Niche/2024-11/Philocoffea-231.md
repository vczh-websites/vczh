### 6bar/94C

- 5/15.0g -> 6/13s 30.0g 3.2\~3.7ml/s, tangerine, juicy, honey and tea not tasted, thickness far away from enough
- 3.5/15.0g -> 7/16s 29.9g 2.1\~2.8ml/s, flavor much more clarified, more sweet but not feel like honey
- 2.5/15.0g -> 6/20s 30.0g 1.2\~2.2ml/s, some honey and red tea, balanced, thickness is enough
  - yes!
  - what about 15 in 40 out?
  - what about starts from 0.5ml/s with 6\~1 bar?
