### 6bar/94C

- 5/15.0g -> 6/13s 30.0g 3.2\~3.7ml/s, tangerine, juicy, honey and tea not tasted, thickness far away from enough
- 3.5/15.0g -> 7/16s 29.9g 2.1\~2.8ml/s, flavor much more clarified, more sweet but not feel like honey
- 2.5/15.0g -> 6/20s 30.0g 1.2\~2.2ml/s, some honey and red tea, balanced, thickness is enough
  - yes!

### 6~1bar/94C

- 1.5/15.0g -> 8/24s 30.3g 1.0\~2.1ml/s, with a little more frothy milk, quite the same
  - try original frothy milk dose
- 0.5/15.0g -> 6/40s 30.0g 0.3\~1.2\~0.9ml/s, super sweet, tea weaker but still there
  - try 40g out
- 0.5/15.0g -> 6/40s 40.2g 0.4\~1.6\~1.1ml/s, more flavor, less sweetness, tea like no much change
