### 8bar/94C

- 5/15.0g -> 7/12s 30.5g 5ml/s, flow rate too high but already full of flavor, no clarity
- 3/15.0g -> 8/18s 30.9g 2.1\~2.8ml/s, a little bit like 152 from the beginning but much more sweet later, long lasting sweet aftertaste

- 2.5/15.0g -> 7/21s 30.5g 1.1\~2.4ml/s, flavor emphasized, no bitterness at all, long lasting sweet in aftertaste
- 1.5/15.0g -> 6/28s 30.5g 0.6\~2.0ml/s, flavor emphasized while thickness also increased, very little bitter when swallowing

### 6\~1bar/94C
