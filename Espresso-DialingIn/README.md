## Dialing In

Keep a proper dose so that after pre-infusion the puck still has a small gap to the group head.

When dose and yield are fixed:
- Grind finer: more extraction, more bitterness, less acidity. Higher risk of channeling.
  - Flow rate usually gets smaller when grind finer.
  - Flow rate usually gets bigger when grind coarser. But when it is too coarse, the flow rate changes insignificantly. The espresso usually tastes worse at such range.
- Higher temperature: slightly more extraction, less emphasized acidity, more sweetness.
- Higher pressure: slightly more extraction, less emphasized acidity.
- (very lighly but under testing) Higher temperature and pressure desolves material quicker, it decreases the flow rate but usually insignificantly. But when the ground is coarse enough, it could increase the flow rate significantly enough, and the effect reverses.
- When grind coarse enough, the variating pressure/temperature profile might not have enough time to implement the variation.
- When the thickness is good but there is a little bitterness, if a flat pressure leads to a consistant raising flow rate, it could extract less in the finishing and maximize the flavor.
- Different bean needs to mix with different amount of milk, to eliminate the rest of the bitterness, while maximized flavor and thickness.

The signal of over-extraction signal is bitterness in long lasting aftertaste.

The signal of channeling is sudden/fast increasing flow rate or decreasing pressure.

If puck suddenly loses pressure for no reason,
it is probably because CO2 is leaking too much since beans are not consumed in time,
just grind half level finer (Niche Duo) and it should be fine again.

It is important to discard some ground right after changing the grind settings,
otherwise different sizes of ground will mix together and make channeling happen more easily.

Over-weighted dose could also lead to uneven extraction
because the puck expands all the way to the group head,
leaving no room to distribute water evenly.

When doing espresso with ice and fresh milk without frothing,
bitter will become obvious,
adjust to emphasizing acidity.

## To Try

### Temperature

- Decreasing temperature seems to affect to pressure as well.
- The best temperature on sweet aftertaste seems to drop when pressure drops.

### Flow Rate

- Flow rate and its rate of changing is the key to taste.
  - Higher pressure or coarser ground could lead to bigger flow rate changing with the same amount of brewing time.
    - Need more tests to compare between different rate of flow rate changing.
  - Need more tests to maintain the same flow rate from different parameter.
    - Grind setting dramatically changes the flow rate.
    - Both lower temperature and pressure affects the flow rate but with different side effect.
  - e.g. different grind/dose(20/18/15)/pressure.

### Puck Prep

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dRYw8yl_dg
- Denser puck (or slower flow) increases body, decreases the risk of channeling.
  - Increase the flow rate of pre-infusion.
  - Increase puck weight
  - Decrease the space between the puck and the shower screen (by using smaller basket).
- Looser puck increases characteristic.
- Thicker puck increases body (by using taper basket).
