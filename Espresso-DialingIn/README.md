## Dialing In

Keep a proper dose so that after pre-infusion the puck still has a small gap to the group head.

When dose and yield are fixed:
- Grind finer: more extraction, more bitterness, less acidity. Higher risk of channeling.
- Higher temperature: slightly more extraction, less emphasized acidity, more sweetness.
- Higher pressure: more thickness, less acidity in aftertaste.

The signal of over-extraction signal is
bitterness in long lasting aftertaste.

The signal of channeling is
sudden/fast increasing flow rate or decreasing pressure.

If puck suddenly loses pressure for no reason,
it is probably because CO2 is leaking too much since beans are not consumed in time,
just grind half level finer (Niche Duo) and it should be fine again.

It is important to discard some ground right after changing the grind settings,
otherwise different sizes of ground will mix together and make channeling happen more easily.

Over-weighted dose could also lead to uneven extraction
because the puck expands all the way to the group head,
leaving no room for spreading water evenly.

When doing espresso with ice and fresh milk without frothing,
bitter will become obvious,
adjust to emphasizing acidity.

## To Try

- Denser puck (or slower flow) increases body, decreases the risk of channeling.
  - Increase the flow rate of pre-infusion.
  - Increase puck weight
  - Decrease the space between the puck and the shower screen (by using smaller basket).
- Looser puck increases characteristic.
- Thicker puck increases body (by using taper basket).
