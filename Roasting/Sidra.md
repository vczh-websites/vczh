# Pepe Jijon Sidra

- 11/28-1 so far the best
  - 11/28-2 a little bitterness
- 12/9 resting, first time without over-roasted bean surface
  - 12/9-2 obvious bitterness
- 12/14 over roasted, too red tea

**IMPORTANT** Record the discharge time, keep the same interval to the next charging. When the machine temperature reaches the target, wait for 90s before changing.

- Rerun 2025-11-28 (1), also apply full damper changin
- Try 150g

The method of lowering charge temperature and elongate yellow point cures the over-roasted bean surface.
But the overall roasting time is significantly longer than enough, making it too red tea.
Here only make both yellow point +5/10s and first crack +5s and see what would happen.

## 2025-12-14, 10C humidify 88%

    - forgot damper 100 at FC
  - 160.2C 4:14; 184.6C 6:36; 188.2C 7:06 +30s
    - changed FC to 185.5C
    - +30s for comparing might be too fast
    - red tea

Significantly aromatic at the end, ~~might mean~~ over roasted.
No bitterness is tasted eating the roasted bean, no over-roasted bean surface issue.

Previous configuration makes 6:00FC a very narrow window.
Try lower the charge temperature to elongate the whole process,
but keep the development unchanged.
Measure agtron of bean and ground.

## 2025-12-9, 10C humidity 82%

    - feels watery
  - 160C 3:33; 184.5C 5:42; 189.3C 6:22; +40s
    - a little bit under roasted

Try to shortern the yellow point and first crack time but seems under-roasted.
This is the first time eating the roasted bean directly without tasting bitterness,
it means it cures the over-roasted bean surface issue.
