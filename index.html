<h1>Welcome to <strong>vczh.net</strong>!</h1>
<h2>C++ code indexing and visualization</h2>
<p>
    The project has the ability to handle overloading resolutions and partially do template instantiation.
</p>
<p>

<h2>Story of the project</h2>
<p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Document/tree/release-1.0">The first version of vczh-libraries/Document</a> was created
    to parse, analyse and index the <a target="_blank" href="https://gaclib.net/doc/ver1/gacui/ref.html">source code of GacUI</a>,
    as well as rendering <a target="_blank" href="https://gaclib.net/doc/ver1/vlppregex/ref/VL__REGEX__REGEX.html">comments as document.</a>
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately after upgrading the project to use Visual Studio 2022,
    I found that the new C++ compiler has a problem dealing with <b>decltype</b> of captured symbols inside nested lambda expressions,
    which makes my whole unit test unable to compile.
    Bugs has been submitted to the VC++ team but not all of them are fixed at the moment.
</p>
<p>
    I realized that the way I do the project is too fancy,
    so in the next version, I decided to rewrite the whole project in a completely different approach,
    which is parsing the C++ source code first, and then resolve symbols.
</p>
<p>
    We know that a typical C++ compiler needs to resolve symbols during parsing in order to handle ambiguities,
    but my project is for indexing code and rendering documents,
    I don't have to resolve symbols 100% precisely, if I see something too complex to handle I could link the symbol to multiple candidates.
</p>
<p>
    So I decided to allow ambiguity during parsing,
    if some interpretations are proven to be incorrect,
    they can be deleted later.
    More importantly, when parsing source code of a template,
    decisions are not always possible to be made before instantiating it.
    Ambiguity is unavoidable.
</p>
<p>
    For example, when the compiler see a statement like <b>a&lt;b&gt;c;</b>,
    it would create an AST containing all possible interpretation of the code: binary expression or variable definition.
    So I created another project to generate a parser in C++ from a syntax that allow almost any possible kind of ambiguity:
